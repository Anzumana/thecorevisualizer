# The Core Visualizer

[See the live demo.](http://cushman.github.io/thecorevisualizer/static/index.html)

This is an interactive demo for StarCraft 2 hotkey layouts, designed around [The Core](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=341878). Written in CoffeeScript with CoffeeCup and Stylus.

The code is very ugly. Mistakes were made. There is no documentation. Contributions are welcome but not recommended at this stage.

Icons are from [SC2 Armory](http://sc2armory.com/), [StarCraft Wiki](http://starcraft.wikia.com/wiki/StarCraft_II), and [Liquidpedia](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/Main_Page) and are presumably &copy; Blizzard.
