# The Core Visualizer

This is an interactive demo for StarCraft 2 hotkey layouts, designed around [The Core](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=341878). Written in CoffeeScript with CoffeeCup and Stylus.

The code is very ugly. Mistakes were made. Please do not judge me.

Icons are from [SC2 Armory](http://sc2armory.com/), [StarCraft Wiki](http://starcraft.wikia.com/wiki/StarCraft_II), and [Liquidpedia](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/Main_Page) and are presumably &copy; Blizzard.
